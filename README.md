Overview
---
This repository contains starting files for the Behavioral Cloning Project.

To meet specifications, the project will require submitting five files: 
* model.py (script used to create and train the model)
* drive.py (script to drive the car - feel free to modify this file)
* model.h5 (a trained Keras model)
* writeup_report.md A description of the model and how it was trained
* video.mp4 (a video recording of your vehicle driving autonomously around the track for at least one full lap)
